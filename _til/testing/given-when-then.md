Given-when-then is a good mnemonic for teaching people the three essential parts of a test. Given `X`, when `Y` happens, then `Z` should be true. If the grammar of this sentence gets too complicated, it suggests that you're testing too many things at once (or perhaps that there's something else about your system that needs simplification).
