I am a software engineering generalist with over ten years experience as a hands-on engineering lead. As an engineer, I believe in writing good, clean, tested code. As a leader, I believe my role is to support the team by working alongside them, hiring good people, offering guidance and mentorship, and removing roadblocks.

## Skill Highlights

* Primary languages: C, C++ (including C++11 and C++14), Java, JavaScript, Python
* Web frameworks and technologies including Django, DropWizard, Flask, Node.js, React, SASS
* NoSQL and SQL data stores, caches, and queues including Cassandra, Couchbase, Kafka, Memcached, MonogDB, RabbitMQ, Redis
* Configuration management with Ansible and Chef
* Extensive experience with Amazon Web Services (AWS) including CloudFront, DynamoDB, EC2, ElastiCache, ELB, RDS, S3
* Design and implementation of scalable, distributed, and highly availabile systems
* Automated testing, continuous integration, continuous delivery
* Experienced leader, mentor, and manager
* Extensive experience implementing agile methodologies (Scrum and Kanban) and devops practices, including right-sizing processes for teams and continuous improvement of processes
* Comfortable conducting client meetings and presenting at conferences
* Strong written and verbal communication skills
* Plays well with others

## Philosophy

* Clean, clear, and testable beats clever
* Over-engineered code is often just as bad as under-thought code
* Automated testing and continuous integration are essential
* No box is sacred: all infrastructure must be fast and trivial to reproduce, all mission critical stateful services must have failovers
* Be as lean as possible: process by the team, for the team
* Only own what you must, but never outsource the core business
* Favor autonomous teams: avoid organizing by specialization, support cross-training, and align resources with business initiatives to faciltiate funding and create clear priorities
