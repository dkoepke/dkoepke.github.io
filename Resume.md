I am a software engineering generalist with over ten years experience as a lead engineer. If you are building a product that you truly believe in, and you need an engineer to help out, let's talk about the problems you're trying to solve and how I can contribute.

## Skill Highlights

* Primary languages: C, C++, JavaScript, Java, PHP, Python, Ruby
* Web: Flask, Pyramid, Sinatra, Express (Node.js), jQuery, HTML, CSS
* NoSQL: Cassandra, CouchBase, Dynamo, MongoDB, Redis
* SQL: MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, RDS, Redshift
* Configuration management: Ansible, Chef
* Extensive experience with Amazon Web Services including CloudFormation, CloudFront, Dynamo, EC2, ELB, Route 53, S3, SNS
* Design and implementation of scalable, distributed, and high availability systems
* Design of RESTful APIs
* Scalable network programming using BSD sockets and ZeroMQ
* Automated testing, continuous integration, continuous delivery
* Experienced leader and mentor
* Comfortable conducting client meetings and presenting at conferences
* Strong written and verbal communication skills
* Plays well with others

## Philosophy

* Clean, clear, and testable beats clever
* Automated testing and continuous integration are essential
* No box is sacred: all configuration must be fast and trivial to reproduce
* Use as lean a methodology as you can: process by the team, for the team
* Only own what you need to (e.g., use Travis CI instead of owning a Jenkins box)
